# React Event Driven
This is from my previous project in React, I showed it to them the proper way to have an scalable and modular solutions, this example incorporates event-driven architecture utilizing the observer pattern and event driven based approach.

## Code Structure

- **Separation of Concerns:** Views (HTML elements inside Components folder )are segregated from core logic to enhance modularity and maintainability. (Logic is inside the Services folder)
- Incorporates event-driven architecture - promotes loose coupling between components because event producers and consumers do not need to have direct knowledge of each other. They only need to understand the format and semantics of the events they produce or consume.
