# React Event Driven
Currently, the feature is actively being developed and incorporates event-driven architecture utilizing the observer pattern.


## Code Structure

- **Separation of Concerns:** Views (HTML elements) are segregated from core logic to enhance modularity and maintainability.

## Next Steps

- Implement error trapping to ensure robust functionality.
- Continuously refine and enhance the 'folder' feature implementation.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview of the current development focus, feature status, and outlines the next steps for further refinement and enhancement.
