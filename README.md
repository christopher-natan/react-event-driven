# React Event Driven
Currently, the feature is actively being developed and incorporates event-driven architecture utilizing the observer pattern.


## Code Structure

- **Separation of Concerns:** Views (HTML elements inside Components folder )are segregated from core logic to enhance modularity and maintainability. (Logic is inside the Services folder)
- Incorporates event-driven architecture - promotes loose coupling between components because event producers and consumers do not need to have direct knowledge of each other. They only need to understand the format and semantics of the events they produce or consume.

## Next Steps

- Implement error trapping to ensure robust functionality.
- Continuously refine and enhance the 'folder' feature implementation.

This structure provides a comprehensive overview of the current development focus, feature status, and outlines the next steps for further refinement and enhancement.
